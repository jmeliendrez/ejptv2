# ðŸ‘€ Enumeration Overview
  Enumeration is one of the beginning phases of a penetration test. This is where we look for the services that are running and attempt to gather information about those services.
  This can include information on login credentials, misconfigured services and understanding the attack surface of a system/network. Below I outline the main tools for enumeration and how to gather information on 5 common services: SMB, FTP, SSH, HTTP, and SQL.
  

## SMB
**What is SMB?**
<p>Server Message Block (SMB) is essentially a communication protocol operating at the application layer. It enables clients to â€˜talkâ€™ to a server. It is primarily on Windows systems while macOS and Linux run clients to connect to an SMB server. It makes it possible for remote users to access data on the server. Furthermore, it enables remote access to other resources such as printers.</p>

<p>Here are a few articles I found helpful in understanding the protocol. It's important to understand the technology you are testing.</p>
