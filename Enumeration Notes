# Enumeration Overview
  Enumeration is one of the beginning phases of a penetration test. This is where we look for the services that are running and attempt to gather information about those services.
  This can include information on login credentials, misconfigured services and understanding the attack surface of a system/network. Below I outline the main tools for enumeration and how to gather information on 5 common services: SMB, FTP, SSH, HTTP, and SQL.
